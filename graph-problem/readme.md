# üï∏Ô∏è Graph Problems

Now let's do the **Graph** topic the same way ‚Äî 30 carefully selected questions, organized cleanly, not overcomplicated but touching **all key patterns** you must know for interviews.

Patterns covered:

- Graph Representations (Adjacency List/Matrix)
- DFS / BFS Traversals
- Cycle Detection (Directed + Undirected)
- Topological Sort
- Shortest Paths (Dijkstra, BFS, etc.)
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)
- MST (Minimum Spanning Tree - Prim's, Kruskal‚Äôs)
- Strongly Connected Components (SCC - Kosaraju's Algo)
