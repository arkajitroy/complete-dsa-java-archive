ðŸ§© **Tips**:

- Master both **adjacency list** and **adjacency matrix** representations.
- Practice both **recursive DFS** and **iterative BFS**.
- For shortest paths, know when to use **BFS**, **Dijkstra**, **Bellman-Ford**, or **Floyd-Warshall**.
- Union-Find is key for **cycle detection**, **MST**, and **connected components**.
